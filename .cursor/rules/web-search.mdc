DO NOT use the default web_search tool. It is currently broken and completely ignores the tool call arguments, returning irrelevant results. You may use the MCP web search tools, if present, which are not broken.

When using web search tools, ask full questions like "How does X work in the last version?". Do not simply list a series of keywords like "X latest version".
